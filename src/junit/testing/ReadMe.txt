	       	         Junit source code for Printtokens2

How to run: Junit class created and ran from Netbeans. File get created on the test folder instead of the source folder(like eclipse does). So when running on Netbeans, use command (alt + F6) or got to the top on the toolbar and click Run --> Test Project(Junit testing).
